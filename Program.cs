//An access modifier in C# specifies who can see and use a resource. 
//You probably are familiar with public and private. 
//We use those a lot but did you know that there are others? 
//In this lesson we are going to cover six different access modifiers and when you would use each. 
//We are also going to discuss why we have various modifiers and it isn't just about security.
